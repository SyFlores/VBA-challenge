# VBA-challenge
This repository serves to analyze stock market data, primarily through the use of VBA. The primary subroutine will be 'StockSummary'. Any additional subroutines may hold major ideas that are implemented in the 'StockSummary' subroutine.

Our goal is to to create a summary table describing three key metrics for each ticker: yearly change, yearly change(%), and total volume.
Be mindful that there are key assumptions made about the chronological nature of the dataset that may allow the solution to run properly. Of note, we are assuming that
any tickers are grouped and in in chronolgical order.
